            <h1>My Digital Portfolio</h1>
            <p>Arnel Hondonero graduated from ACN Senior High School in 2019 with a BS in innovation.  His portfolio is very organized with easy navigation. 
                Arnel utilized his own analytical skills to give readers a better sense of his passions.  Since Arnel graduated, we’ve followed his journey, which led him to the temperate rainforest of Nabunturan. 
                He recently reached out to let us know that prospective employers enjoyed looking at his digital portfolio, because it gave them a “better understanding of who I was and what my goals are.” 
                He went on to say perspective employers could tell by his portfolio that he had a vision, a general plan for his future and how the role he was interviewing for fit into that plan. 
                These are all important things to think about when designing and selecting content to your portfolio.</p>
